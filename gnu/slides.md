## Why was GNU created?

* Richard Stallman watched a community he loved crumble
* He was fed up with proprietary software
* Wanted to recreate that community that he loved
	- Decided to write a free operating system
	- Free as in freedom

---

## Philosophy

* What is free?
	- Free as in beer ($$$$)
	- Free as in freedom
	- Freedom does not imply free as in price
	- Freedom means:
		- Free to use however
		- Whenever
		- On whatever
		- Source code is available
		- You can do *what you want to do*

---

## How

* The problem with other free software licenses
	- Wrong goals
	- Too permissive
* The solution: Copyleft!
	- Not the opposite of copyright
	- Uses copyright as a means for keeping the software free
	- Permissions to do anything except for adding restrictions
	- Infectious: Modified versions must also be free

---

## Some GNU Licenses

* GNU General Public License (GPL)
	- Most well-known license
	- Can cause licensing issues in large projects
	- Enterprise tends to avoid

* Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL)
	- Allows proprietary software to link to the software

---

## Impact on Computing

* Helped lead to the popularity GNU/Linux systems
	- When you think Linux you think GNU Coreutils
	- GNU/Linux is dominant in the server world
* Some of the best software
	- Web servers
	- Source control
	- Compilers

## Personal Impact

* Empowered a generation of programmers
	- GNU/Linux has all of the tools
	- Lower barrier of entry
	- Source code is available
	- Freedom to modify
* Peace of mind

---

## Community Impact

* Stallman got his community back
* Open source software has flourished
	- More options than ever
	- Even corporations get involved now
* Viable business model 

---

## Ethical Issues with Free Software

* Utilitarian Perspective
	- Does it discourage innovation?
	- What is the balance?
* Fairness Perspective

---

## Ethical Issues with the GNU Project

* Is copyleft really more free?
	- It adds more restrictions than something like the MIT license
	- Is that really freedom?

---

## Recap

* GNU is a collection of userland software
* Pair it with the Linux kernel and you get Ubuntu/Fedora/etc
* It's a free operating system, but also a free software movement
* Free means freedom, as in you are free to do what you want
* With the rise of the internet we now have a huge open source community  

---

## Conclusion on the GNU Project

* Good intentions
	- Questionable implementation
* Few people are actively against open source software
	- But there are definitely critics of the GPL

---

Open source is a net positive for the computing world

---

Richard Stallman and the GNU Project built the open source community that we have today
